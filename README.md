_See the backend [here](https://github.com/LutherNa/GroceryAppFrontend)_

For my second project with Revature my group and I were taksed with building our first full-stack application. To that end we decided to make a shopping assistant app relying on the [Kroger API](https://developer.kroger.com/reference/). 

## User Stories:

* [x] Choose Kroger Location
* [x] Make a new shopping list
* [X] Add and Remove items from a shopping list. 
* [X] View an existing shopping list
* [x] Search for an item by name
